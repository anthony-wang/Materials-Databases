* Please feel free to edit these tables, change headings as necessary, group databases and codes into relevant sub-groups, and add information dynamically. 
* For now,  hold off on linking to this page externally, as I will be moving it to be within the Globus github if we see usefulness emerging.

| [3D Materials Atlas](https://cosmicweb.mse.iastate.edu/wiki/display/home/Materials+Atlas+Home) | The Materials Atlas contains a repository for 3D experiments and simulations on a variety of material systems. |   |   |  |
| [Interatomic Potentials Repository Project](http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/) | This repository provides a source for interatomic potentials (force fields), related files, and evaluation tools to help researchers obtain interatomic models and judge their quality and applicability. | Chandler Becker (NIST), Zachary Trautt (NIST)  |   |  |
| [Web Force-Field (WebFF)](http://www.nist.gov/mml/msed/polymers/webff.cfm) | The Web Force-Field (WebFF) repository consists of three main components: 1) a database, 2) a software engine, and 3) a web-client interface. The repository database supports a multi-table format, where each table is a distinct force field. | Frederick Phelan (NIST)  |   |  |
| [ThermoML](http://trc.nist.gov/ThermoML.html) | This page contains links to ThermoML files, which represent experimental thermophysical and thermochemical property data reported in the corresponding articles published by major journals in the field. These files are posted here through cooperation between the Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the journal publishers. |   |   |  |


#Relevant Codes
| Code | Description | Maintained by | API/Docs | 
| ------------- | ------------- |-----------|------| 
| [MAterials Simulation Toolkit (MAST)](http://pythonhosted.org/MAST/index.html)  | MAST is an automated workflow manager and post-processing tool.MAST focuses on diffusion and defect workflows that use density functional theory. It interfaces primarily with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP).| Dane Morgan | [docs](http://pythonhosted.org/MAST/index.html)  |
| [NWChem](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Main_Page)  | NWChem aims to provide its users with computational chemistry tools that are scalable both in their ability to treat large scientific computational chemistry problems efficiently, and in their use of available parallel computing resources from high-performance parallel supercomputers to conventional workstation clusters. | PNNL | [docs](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Release65:NWChem_Documentation)  |
