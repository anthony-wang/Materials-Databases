# Materials-Related Databases

| Database | Description | Contact | API/Docs | Size| 
| ------------- | ------------- |-----------|------|------| 
| [The Materials Project](https://www.materialsproject.org)  | Harnessing the power of supercomputing and state of the art electronic structure methods, the Materials Project provides open web-based access to computed information on known and predicted materials as well as powerful analysis tools to inspire and design novel materials. | Kristin Persson, Gerbrand Ceder | [python](https://www.materialsproject.org/docs/api)  | 58000 compounds, 33000 band structures|
| [Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD)](http://oqmd.org)  | The OQMD is a database DFT calculated thermodynamic and structural properties. We are providing this online interface for convenient, small scale access; however for more powerful utilization we recommend downloading the entire database and the API for interfacing with it, detailed in the link below. | Chris Wolverton | [python (qmpy)](http://oqmd.org/static/docs/index.html)  | 285780 compounds|
| [Automatic Flow for Materials Discovery (AFLOW)](http://www.aflowlib.org) | A distributed materials properties repository from high-throughput ab initio calculations | Stefano Curtarolo     | [REST](http://aflowlib.duke.edu/aflowwiki/doku.php?id=documentation:start)  | 630000 compounds |

#Relevant Codes
| Code | Description | Contact | API/Docs | 
| ------------- | ------------- |-----------|------| 
| [MAterials Simulation Toolkit (MAST)](http://pythonhosted.org/MAST/index.html)  | MAST is an automated workflow manager and post-processing tool.MAST focuses on diffusion and defect workflows that use density functional theory. It interfaces primarily with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP).| Dane Morgan | [docs](http://pythonhosted.org/MAST/index.html)  |
| [NWChem](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Main_Page)  | NWChem aims to provide its users with computational chemistry tools that are scalable both in their ability to treat large scientific computational chemistry problems efficiently, and in their use of available parallel computing resources from high-performance parallel supercomputers to conventional workstation clusters. | PNNL | [docs](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Release65:NWChem_Documentation)  |
| [pymatgen 3.0.9](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymatgen)  | Pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) is a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. It currently powers the public Materials Project (http://www.materialsproject.org), an initiative to make calculated properties of all known inorganic materials available to materials researchers. These are some of the main features: | Materials Genome Initiative | [docs](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymatgen)  |
